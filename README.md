# EULER: Enhancing the Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models through Error-Induced Learning

This repository contains the source code for the paper: [EULER: Enhancing the Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models through Error-Induced Learning]().

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities and achieved promising results in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Learning from errors offers the potential to further enhance the performance of LLMs during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, the errors in synthesized solutions are typically gathered from sampling trails, making it challenging to generate solution errors for each mathematical problem.This paper introduces the Error-IndUced LEaRning (EULER) model, which aims to develop an error exposure model that generates high-quality solution errors to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
